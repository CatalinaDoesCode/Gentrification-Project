         <h3>Facts</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>Gentrification affects people who live in low income neighborhoods. These people tend to be people of color.</li>
             <li>The problem is not individuals. It is usually large real estate companies buying real estate in "up and coming" neighborhoods.</li>
             <li>The cost of living goes up because the area now has a higher value. Buisnesses and real estate companies value profit so they increase prices of goods and rent also goes up.</li>
             <li> As a result the poor people who once lived in the gentrifying area can no longer afford to live there. These people then become displaced in order to appease the affluent.</li>
             <li>Manufacturing jobs are lost to gentrification. Due to increasing rent prices small manufacturers can't afford to stay in once convenient locations.</li>
             <li>Service jobs (retail and food services) do increase in gentrifying areas. New buisnesses = more jobs</li>
         </ul>
